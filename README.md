# Sparkify SQL Data Modeling

__1. Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.__

Sparkify's rapid user growth calls for better analytical organisation and infrastructure. The purpose of this database is to organize user data into an industry standard __Star Schema__ with one fact table and some dimension tables.

__2. State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.__

Data Engineers at Sparkify believe that the __Star Schema__ is the best way to organize user data.

__`songplays`__ is our fact table with the following columns with `songplay_id` & `user_id` as primary key:
- songplay_id
- start_time 
- user_id 
- level
- song_id
